## Hello, I'm David 👋

I'm a front-end developer based in London 🇬🇧, passionate about building blazing-fast websites that integrate motion and 3D elements. I love pushing the boundaries of web design and creating code-driven animations. 🔥

## What I Do

- 🖥️ **Front-End Development**: Creating high-performance websites powered by Astro and React.
- 🎨 **Creative Coding**: Bringing ideas to life with interactive visuals, animations, and 3D elements.
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, WebGL, WebGPU, and WASM (WebAssembly).

## What I'm Exploring

- **Shader Programming**: Crafting silky smooth animations and pixel manipulation with the power of the GPU.
- **Low-Level Languages**: Currently learning Swift and Metal, focusing on pixel crunching with high-performance APIs.
